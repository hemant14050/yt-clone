/**
Assignment: Web Application Development for React Internship

Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to create a functional web application using React.js to showcase your understanding of fundamental web development concepts, your proficiency with JavaScript and React, and your ability to create a user-friendly UI/UX.

Task:
You are to build a simplified "YouTube Clone" web application. This application should allow users to:

View a list of predefined video thumbnails.
Click on a thumbnail to play the video.
See basic information about the video such as the title and description.


Note: You will be calling the videos API in a paginated manner. 
(Read this to know more about API pagination - https://nordicapis.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-api-pagination/) 

For fetching videos use the below-mentioned API

curl --location --request GET 'https://internship-service.onrender.com/videos?page=2'

`page` starts with 0 and you should call the API with incremented values for Pagination.


Requirements:

React Components: Your app should properly use React components, demonstrating the ability to manage and maintain state and props effectively.

User Interface: The app should have a clean, intuitive user interface that makes it easy to browse videos and play them.

Video Playback: You can use any public API or local data to retrieve videos. Use HTML5 video or a library like react-player for video playback.

State Management: The app should properly manage the state of the video list and the currently selected/playing video.

Note: You will be calling the videos API in a paginated manner. 
(Read this to know more about API pagination - https://nordicapis.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-api-pagination/) 

For fetching videos use the below-mentioned API

curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:6000/videos?page=2'

`page` starts with 0 and you should call the API with incremented values for Pagination.




Bonus (not required, but will add value):

Responsiveness: Make the design responsive so it works on various screen sizes and devices.
